# location

My current whereabouts.

A web interface to display a map of locations generated by the
[somewhere](https://github.com/dylanpyle/somewhere) command-line tool.

Available at [https://location.dylanpyle.com](https://location.dylanpyle.com)

The `update-location` script is run hourly via a cron job on my primary machine.
